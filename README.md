## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains detailed shipment records, including shipment ID, arrival and departure dates, cargo type, shipping company, port of origin and destination, tonnage, and delay days.

### Key Attributes:
- **Shipment_ID**: Unique identifier for each shipment.
- **Arrival_Date** & **Departure_Date**: Dates when the shipment arrived and departed.
- **Cargo_Type**: Type of cargo transported (e.g., Vehicles, General Cargo, Liquid Bulk).
- **Shipping_Company**: Company responsible for transportation.
- **Port_of_Origin** & **Port_of_Destination**: Departure and arrival locations.
- **Tonnage**: Weight of the cargo in metric tons.
- **Delay_Days**: Days delayed in transit (negative values indicate early arrival).

## Analysis Conducted
The project includes the following analytical components:
1. **Delay Analysis**: Evaluated shipment delays across different routes and cargo types.
2. **Company Performance**: Compared on-time performance across various shipping companies.
3. **Port Efficiency**: Assessed port operations to identify congestion patterns.
4. **Cargo-Type Impact**: Examined how different cargo types influence delays.
5. **Predictive Insights**: Identified factors contributing to delays to improve future shipping forecasts.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** & **PostgreSQL** for Data extraction, transformation, and quering
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis
- **Data Visualization** Graphs and charts for insights representation
- **Statistical Methods** for identifying trends and patterns

## Findings & Recommendations
- **Key Findings**:
  - Certain cargo types, such as General Cargo and Containers, experience higher delays.
  - Some shipping companies exhibit better on-time performance than others.
  - Specific ports show congestion trends that impact shipment efficiency.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Optimize port scheduling to reduce congestion.
  - Implement predictive models to forecast delays.
  - Enhance logistics planning by partnering with high-performing shipping companies.
